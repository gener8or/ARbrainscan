# Brainscan AR Demo 

A frictionless (no-install) AR-experience using AR.js (via [AR.js Studio](https://ar-js-org.github.io/studio/). 

AR.js Studio provides a dead-simple way to create a hosted AR web page. The AR marker used in setting up the app can be integrated into the QR code "logo" section of many common QR code generator apps such as Beaconstac. 

Hat tip to jennyseong for the 3d brain model used in the demo via [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/some-kind-of-brain-thing-a1dc3a8349a449c2b037ee703bedb246).
